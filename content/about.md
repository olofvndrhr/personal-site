My name is Ivan Schaller, and im a DevOps/Network Engineer at Swisscom (Schweiz) AG.

My work is a combination of Operation in Networking and Development in Automation.

---

The main task of our team is the operation and development of multiple L2 and L3 network platforms for business customers across Switzerland.

My work projects are mostly related to lifecycle and platform expansion and the operation of our BGP-MPLS and BGP-VPLS networks.
But we are moving slowly to a NSO-managed EVPN over SRV6 network.

The network equipment im most familiar with is from Cisco and Juniper. And from configuration to diagnostics I use about every aspect of it.

On the development side, I create internal tools, automate common networking tasks and lifecycle operations.
